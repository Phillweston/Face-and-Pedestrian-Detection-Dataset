# Face and Pedestrian Detection Dataset
Detection dataset designed for Integrated Detection Method of Pedestrian and Face.

## Introduction
The FEEDS (Face pEdestrain dEtection DataSet) dataset is integrated with both face and pedatrian detection bounding boxes, contains 82735 annotated pedestrian bounding boxes and 20771 annotated face bounding boxes. 

Our dataset is collected from three different dataset:
- [PRW](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_prw.html) (Person Re-identification in the Wild) dataset.
- [WIDER Pedestrian](http://wider-challenge.org/terms_and_conditions_2018.html) dataset.
- [CUHK Person Search](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/PS/dataset.html) (Large Scale Benchmark for Person Search) dataset.

Dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduYun Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bbCfi7XKv64xGwc5yZnIKA).
